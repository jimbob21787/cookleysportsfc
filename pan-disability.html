      </p>

      <p>Our aim is to provide a safe space for SEN children to participate in football whilst developing their social
        skills. We like to think we offer a pathway of “guided discovery” where children can engage at their own pace
        whilst being encouraged to develop themselves individually.</p>

      <p>All the coaches are DBS checked, and first aid qualified whilst holding a minimum Level 1 FA certificate in
        training. In addition, we also have a Child Welfare Officer.</p>

      <p>Affiliation is with Worcestershire FA, our county governing body.</p>

      </p>

      <p>Our Comets programme is for those children, currently aged 5 -11 (under review for 12+), looking for activities
        that are aimed at non- competitive football, but more to enjoy an outdoor activity, or for those who have never
        tried football before.</p>

      <p>We meet on Saturdays at Cookley Sports Club, Lea Lane, Cookley, DY10 3RH starting at 10.00am until 11.00am.
        Session fees are currently £3.00 for the hour, with the preferred option to pay directly into the Club bank
        account.</p>

      <p>All monies raised are for the benefit of the children and hire of facilities.</p>

      <p>We also hold various social events throughout the year, such as a Christmas party, Easter Egg Hunt, Halloween
        party, Virtual Race Nights and many more. We also operate a Club shop selling bespoke merchandise.</p>

      <p>Throughout the year we enter various football tournaments and each week, the coaches award a “Star of the Week”
        certificate to a child based on several factors being considered.</p>
